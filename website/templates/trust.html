		<h2>History</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p class="body-text">The water supply was named after Thomas Hobson, a local entrepreneur and carrier of goods between Cambridge and London. When he died in 1631, Thomas Hobson left funds in his will to set up a Trust to look after the ground on both sides of the ‘new river’ and the water course itself.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Although the ‘new river’ provided fresh water for the townspeople and colleges, it never completely cleared the King’s Ditch, which was eventually covered over. Today, the stream, the Conduit head and the runnels as well as the supply to the botanic garden and the college pools all remain a vital, visible part of Cambridge heritage.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Cambridge citizens and our many visitors also benefit from the wide variety of plant and animal wildlife that this high quality green corridor supports. The Trustees hope that these goals are very much in the spirit generated by Thomas Hobson and the original founders.</p>

		<h2>Volunteer for the trust</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-9">
				<p class="intro-text">The Hobson’s Conduit Trustees rely on volunteers to help keep the banks, paths and the brook clear and help with assessing different species in the BioBlitz.  This makes sure that water flow and its environs are maintained so everyone can enjoy this ancient waterway.</p>

				<h3>What do our volunteers do?</h3>
				<p class="body-text">In the last months, volunteers have removed discarded ironwork, various items of clothing and even an odd shoe! This is in addition to the usual bottles, cups, cans and pieces of fallen timber, which regularly find their way into the water.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Our volunteers have also helped in identifying animal and plant species found along the stream during the Hobson’s Conduit Bioblitz. (need link to internal page about Bioblitz here). This will help quantify the wildlife in and around the brook over the next few years to be sure that the present broad diversity of species is maintained for the future.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The volunteers also enjoy the social aspect of the work with refreshments during and after work on the brook. Trustees and interested specialists provide briefings about Hobson’s Conduit, its history and development and wildlife in this important heritage area.</p>
				<p class="body-text">We are very grateful to our volunteers but are always looking to recruit. If you would like more information please contact <a href="mailto:Toni.Birkin@cambridge.gov.uk">Toni Birkin</a>
