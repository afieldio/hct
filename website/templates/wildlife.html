			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>In the first assessment of wildlife in Hobson’s brook, more than 40 experts and 160 volunteers in ‘The Hobson’s Conduit Bioblitz’ have identified over 330 animal and plant species along this four-mile stretch of water.</p>
				<p>At Ninewells Local Nature Reserve, 166 species were identified including 35 birds, 5 mammals, 2 fish, 50 invertebrates (including 30 moths) and 74 plants. At Empty Common over 230 species were seen including 17 birds, 4 mammals, 2 fish, 1 reptile, 106 invertebrates (39 moths) and 103 plants (link to data table). Importantly only 76 species were common to both sites indicating considerable diversity along Hobson’s Brook. This study confirms the importance of maintaining high-quality water flow in the continued success of this ecosystem so close to Cambridge city.</p>
				<p>For detailed lists of flora and fauna seen during the Bioblitz see these tables (link to tables).  This section of the website shows some of the plant and animal species seen along the water course.</p>

				<h3>Water Voles</h3>
				<p>Water Voles (Ratty from Wind in the Willows) are found along the whole water course. They are a similar size to brown rats, but have rounder faces, darker fur and smaller ears. Water Voles dig burrows close to the water’s edge and nibble vegetation along the banks and are a protected species.</p>

				<p>Muntjac deer (originally from China) are often seen in urban gardens close to the brook banks. They are russet brown in summer and they breed all year round. The males have short antlers and a characteristic bark, often heard at night which can be mistaken for a fox.</p>
