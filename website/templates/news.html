Mr Robert Noel from the <a href="https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk">College of Arms</a> has identified them for the Trustees.  The shields on the right are the Coat of Arms of Cambridge University (top) and Cambridge Town (bottom).</p>
			<p class="intro-text">The others may represent benefactors.  The plaque at the top left is the shield for the Fitzwilliam â€“ Wentworth family. The red lozenges from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Fitzwilliam">Fitzwilliam family</a> and chevron with leopards from Watson Wentworth side.  The two families were united in marriage in 1744.The other (bottom left) shield attribution is complex but may represent a variation of the Perne family crest.</p>
