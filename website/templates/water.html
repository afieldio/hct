				<p class="intro-text">An abundant flow of water in Hobson’s Brook is essential to preserve biodiversity and the local environment. High quality water is required for the University Botanic Garden, the Trumpington Street runnels and Colleges. Despite problems with changing use of nearby land, a profusion of plant and animal species still thrive along the brook and water quality remains high.</p>

		<h2>Nine Wells</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p class="body-text">There are only 160 chalk streams in England. Rainwater falling on high ground is filtered through the chalk where it is stored for some months. The water cools to about 10oC before emerging in springs lower down the slopes.  Nine Wells is the source for a small chalk stream (the term Nine in medieval times reflects a large but not exact number), with many sources where water has (some now dried up), and still does bubble up from the underground reservoir. </p>

		<h2>Water Flow</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p class="body-text">Reduction in water flow from Nine Wells has resulted from dryer summers and increased water extraction to supply the increasing population. Visually this affects water supply to the water course itself and increased algal growth but also limits flow in the Trumpington Street runnels as well as the Colleges. More importantly reduced levels of dissolved oxygen, water stagnation and reduces capacity to support aquatic life downstream particularly the pollution sensitive species like flatworms and caddisflies. In the 1976 hot summer, the underground spring heads dried up. Subsequently, Polycelis, a flatworm that has inhabited chalk streams since the last ice age, has not been seen at Nine Wells.</p>

		<h2>Priorities for the future</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-9">
				<p class="intro-text">Anglian Water have installed flow monitors at Nine Wells to try to ensure this keeps at 20 litres/second. Plans are under discussion with Cambridge Water to maintain the flow of water at Nine Wells when the aquifer flow is limited.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p class="body-text"></p>
				<p class="body-text">Chemical pollution is less of a problem with efficient use of fertilisers. The new housing developments mean that surface water now doesn’t drain into the farmland. Balance ponds in Trumpington Park take the excess surface water and provide a reservoir for excess water before regulating its entry into the stream, These ponds provide a haven for animal and plant wildlife and also reduce damage to water quality.</p>
				<p class="body-text">It might even be possible to consider reintroduction of Polycelis once water flow at Nine Wells can be guaranteed.  A more systematic monitoring of the ecology of the area around the brook has taken its first steps with the Bioblitz in summer 2017.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Hobson’s Brook remains a precious part of South Cambridge.  The green corridor through which the chalk stream flows is highly valued by residents and visitors alike for its semi-rural peace and ecological diversity.  Hobson’s Conduit Trustees and their partners are working to make the future as bright as possible for this historic waterway.</p>
