				<p class="intro-text">Hobson’s Conduit Trust was set up by Thomas Hobson to maintain good quality water flow from Nine Wells into Cambridge.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In 1614, a collaboration between Cambridge City, Cambridge University and the Mayor of Trumpington built a ‘new river’ diverting clean water from Vicar’s Brook in Trumpington into Cambridge. The aim was to reduce the risks of infection following drinking contaminated water.</p>
				<p class="body-text">This ‘new river’ delivered uncontaminated water to some colleges and Cambridge market square. In his will of 1631, Hobson provided funds to set up the Trust that bears his name to maintain the quantity and quality of the water flow.</p>
				<p class="body-text">This website gives information about the history of the waterway, the Trust and its role today.</p>

		<h2>History of Hobson's Conduit</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p class="intro-text">In the early 1600’s, Cambridge Town, University authorities, and the Lord of the Manor in Trumpington collaborated to create a ‘new river’ to bring fresh water to Cambridge. At the time plague and other fatal infections were thought to be caused by contaminated water. A constant supply of fresh water was designed to reduce the risk for the population.</p>
				<p class="body-text">This collaboration established rights over the water course from Nine Wells and the soil on either side to maintain it in good order.  In 1632, Thomas Hobson bequeathed land to fund and maintain the public water supply.  Since that time Hobson’s name has been associated with this water supply.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p class="body-text">Benefactors have continued to give various sources of funds to maintain Hobson’s Conduit.  In early years a group of feoffees (Trustees) were responsible for managing the monies on behalf the town and the university.  The Conduit Trust was first registered with the Charity Commission in 1868 with minor alterations in 1899.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Initially, fifteen trustees were appointed, five by the City of Cambridge with ten persons residents or businessmen from Cambridge co-opted to help.  The Trust now consists of fifteen interested volunteer trustees from Cambridge and the surrounding area.</p>
